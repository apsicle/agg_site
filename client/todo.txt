1) Add infinite scrolling of posts + paginate posts from API.

2) Style the main posts page and post preview boxes.

3) Figure out how to cache the posts page so you don't have to query the API every time. Or find a way to cache the result on the API's side.

4) Create subleddit model and add many-to-many relationship between users and subleddits. Foreign key from post to subleddit (foreign key is
always on the many side of the many-one relationship. There are multiple posts in a subleddit. But only one subleddit per post.)
